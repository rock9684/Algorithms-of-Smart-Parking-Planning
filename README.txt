1. Load the Juypter notebook in Google colab
2. Restart and run all
3. When asked to upload file, upload "filtered_ext_FriAM.json" in the zip file
4. View results until all the code blocks are run

Note:
For Differential evolution algorithm, if the cost is greater than 1000000, the result is not eligible, please re-run the related code blocks.

For particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm, if the cost convergence plot does not properly converge as shown in the report, it is recommended to re-run the related code blocks.
